# Problem Statement
A ski resort company is planning to construct a new ski slope using a pre-existing network of 
mountain huts and trails between them. A new slope has to begin at one of the mountain huts, 
have a middle station at another hut connected with the first one by a direct trail, and end at 
the third mountain hut which is also connected by a direct trail to the second hut. The altitude 
of the three huts chosen for constructing the ski slope has to be strictly decreasing.

## Input Tables
### table_01

### table_02

Each entry in the table trails represents a direct connection between huts with IDs hut1 and 
hut2. Note that all trails are bidirectional.
Create a query that finds all triplets(startpt,middlept,endpt) representing the mountain huts 
that may be used for construction of a ski slope.
